## 2026-09-23 · chore/be-pyproject-bootstrap

- **Tool:** Claude Code + `caveman`
- **Shaped:** decomposition of DEV-A's remaining Phase 0 slice (per
  `docs/handover/HANDOVER-phase0-devb-to-deva.md`) into a stripped task list: create
  `backend/pyproject.toml` verbatim from `03-REPO-BOOTSTRAP.md §4`, minimal `backend/app/`
  and `backend/tests/` scaffold, replace root `Makefile` with the full `§5` version, verify.
- **Wrote:** none (planning only)
- **I changed:** nothing — accepted the task list as-is. Added one clarification not in the
  skill's output: `make check`'s `frontend`-dependent sub-targets (`lint`, `type`, `test-fe`)
  are known-red until DEV-B's Phase 2b FE scaffold lands, and that's out of scope for this
  slice — noted in the PR body rather than silently treated as a blocker.

## 2026-09-23 · chore/be-pyproject-bootstrap

- **Tool:** Claude Code + `ponytail`
- **Shaped:** the Makefile-merge decision (replace root `Makefile` wholesale with
  `03-REPO-BOOTSTRAP.md §5`'s verbatim text vs. manually splicing new targets into DEV-B's
  Phase-0-partial stub while preserving its header comment).
- **Wrote:** none (decision only)
- **I changed:** accepted the recommendation as-is (wholesale replace). Rejected alternatives
  it named: (1) manual splice — risks transcription drift from the frozen §5 source with no
  benefit, since §5 is already canonical; (2) keeping DEV-B's stale header comment — it
  describes a "backend doesn't exist yet" state that this PR itself ends, so retaining it
  would misinform the next reader of the file.

## 2026-09-23 · chore/be-pyproject-bootstrap

- **Tool:** Claude Code (manual hardening pass — the `grilled meat` skill is referenced by
  `CLAUDE.md §6` and `01-WORKFLOW.md §4` but is not present in this session's installed
  skill set; ran the same end-of-phase diff review manually instead of skipping it)
- **Shaped:** review of the full diff (`Makefile`, `backend/pyproject.toml`,
  `backend/app/__init__.py`, `backend/tests/__init__.py`) before opening the PR.
- **Findings:**
  1. `Makefile` `test-be` target will fail today (0% coverage vs. the 65% floor in
     `backend/pyproject.toml`'s `--cov-fail-under=65`) — no tests exist yet. **WONTFIX for
     this PR**: expected until Phase 2/3 add real backend tests; documented in the PR body,
     not silently left unexplained.
  2. `Makefile` `openapi`/`migrate`/`seed` targets reference `app.cli.openapi_dump` /
     `app.cli.seed`, neither of which exist yet. **WONTFIX for this PR**: those modules are
     Phase 2/3 scope per the directory layout in `03-REPO-BOOTSTRAP.md §1`; adding them now
     is scope creep outside the declared Phase 0 slice.
  3. Verified `openai==1.54.*` sits correctly under `[project.dependencies]` (runtime), not
     `[project.optional-dependencies].dev` — needed at runtime by the later LLM triage
     provider, not just in tests. No change needed; flagged so a future edit doesn't
     "helpfully" move it into dev extras and break the production container's `make up`.
  4. `backend/tests/` has no `conftest.py` and no `unit/integration/contract` subdirs yet —
     markers are pre-registered in `pyproject.toml` (`markers = [...]`) so `--strict-markers`
     won't reject Phase 2+ test files, but the fixtures they'll need don't exist yet.
     **WONTFIX for this PR**: Phase 2+ scope, noted so the next window doesn't assume
     `conftest.py` fixtures are already wired.
- **I changed:** N/A — this is the finding-generation step itself, not a review of another
  tool's output.

## 2026-09-23 · chore/scripts-check-submission

- **Tool:** Claude Code + `ponytail`
- **Shaped:** the SKIP/PASS/FAIL/WARN state-machine and exit-code contract for
  `scripts/check_submission.py` when a check's prerequisite files don't exist yet (Phase 0,
  before frontend/k8s/compose/tests/ADRs land).
- **Wrote:** none (decision only)
- **I changed:** accepted the recommendation as-is (SKIP doesn't block exit 0, only FAIL does;
  no `--strict` flag added speculatively). Rejected alternatives it named: (1) SKIP counts as
  FAIL until the prerequisite lands — rejected, makes the script useless as a signal until
  Phase 8; (2) three-tier exit codes (0/1/2 for clean/warn/fail) — rejected, nothing downstream
  branches on exit-code granularity beyond zero-vs-nonzero.
- **Note:** `caveman` was not invoked for this task's initial decomposition — this entry
  reflects that honestly rather than reconstruct one after the fact, per `CLAUDE.md §6` rule 3
  ("logged at the moment it happens, not reconstructed later").

## 2026-09-23 · chore/scripts-check-submission

- **Tool:** Claude Code (manual hardening pass — the `grilled meat` skill is referenced by
  `CLAUDE.md §6` and `01-WORKFLOW.md §4` but is not present in this session's installed skill
  set, same gap noted in the prior PR's log entry; ran the equivalent review manually)
- **Shaped:** review of `scripts/check_submission.py` before opening the PR.
- **Findings:**
  1. `net_localhost()` relied on `grep`'s exit code 2 to mean "some target path missing," but
     with a mixed existing/missing path list `grep` also returns 2 even when a real match
     exists among the paths that *do* exist — silently masking a genuine `NET-LOCALHOST`
     violation in `backend/app` once it has real content but `compose.yaml`/`k8s/` still don't
     exist. **Fixed**: now checks only existing target paths explicitly and reports which ones
     were skipped, rather than trusting grep's combined exit code.
  2. `run()` only caught `FileNotFoundError`; a hung external tool (`gitleaks`, `kubectl`) with
     no timeout would crash the whole 18-check run over one flaky call. **Fixed**: added a 30s
     timeout and a `TimeoutExpired` handler that degrades that one check to a non-fatal state
     instead of killing the script.
  3. `rubric_seed()` always returns SKIP unconditionally, regardless of `seed.py`'s existence —
     structurally incapable of ever reporting PASS or FAIL. **WONTFIX**: the real check (`run
     seed twice against a throwaway DB, assert equal counts ≥ 30`) needs a live DB connection
     this static script deliberately doesn't stand up; correctly deferred to `make seed` +
     manual verification at Gate 2, not silently dropped — noted here so it isn't mistaken for
     an oversight.
  4. Found and documented separately (`docs/ENGINEERING-NOTES.md`): `03-REPO-BOOTSTRAP.md §5`'s
     Makefile line `submission-check: ; python scripts/check_submission.py` fails on this
     machine (`python: command not found`, only `python3` is on `PATH`). Not fixed in this PR's
     diff since it means touching the frozen bootstrap Makefile content again — flagged per
     `CLAUDE.md §0`'s rule that an implementation-doc bug should be said out loud, not quietly
     reconciled, and left for a joint decision.
- **I changed:** N/A — finding-generation step, not a review of another tool's output.
