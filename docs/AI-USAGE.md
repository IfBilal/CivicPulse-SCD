## 2026-09-23 · chore/be-pyproject-bootstrap

- **Tool:** Claude Code + `caveman`
- **Shaped:** decomposition of DEV-A's remaining Phase 0 slice (per
  `docs/handover/HANDOVER-phase0-devb-to-deva.md`) into a stripped task list: create
  `backend/pyproject.toml` verbatim from `03-REPO-BOOTSTRAP.md §4`, minimal `backend/app/`
  and `backend/tests/` scaffold, replace root `Makefile` with the full `§5` version, verify.
- **Wrote:** none (planning only)
- **I changed:** nothing — accepted the task list as-is. Added one clarification not in the
  skill's output: `make check`'s `frontend`-dependent sub-targets (`lint`, `type`, `test-fe`)
  are known-red until DEV-B's Phase 2b FE scaffold lands, and that's out of scope for this
  slice — noted in the PR body rather than silently treated as a blocker.

## 2026-09-23 · chore/be-pyproject-bootstrap

- **Tool:** Claude Code + `ponytail`
- **Shaped:** the Makefile-merge decision (replace root `Makefile` wholesale with
  `03-REPO-BOOTSTRAP.md §5`'s verbatim text vs. manually splicing new targets into DEV-B's
  Phase-0-partial stub while preserving its header comment).
- **Wrote:** none (decision only)
- **I changed:** accepted the recommendation as-is (wholesale replace). Rejected alternatives
  it named: (1) manual splice — risks transcription drift from the frozen §5 source with no
  benefit, since §5 is already canonical; (2) keeping DEV-B's stale header comment — it
  describes a "backend doesn't exist yet" state that this PR itself ends, so retaining it
  would misinform the next reader of the file.

## 2026-09-23 · chore/be-pyproject-bootstrap

- **Tool:** Claude Code (manual hardening pass — the `grilled meat` skill is referenced by
  `CLAUDE.md §6` and `01-WORKFLOW.md §4` but is not present in this session's installed
  skill set; ran the same end-of-phase diff review manually instead of skipping it)
- **Shaped:** review of the full diff (`Makefile`, `backend/pyproject.toml`,
  `backend/app/__init__.py`, `backend/tests/__init__.py`) before opening the PR.
- **Findings:**
  1. `Makefile` `test-be` target will fail today (0% coverage vs. the 65% floor in
     `backend/pyproject.toml`'s `--cov-fail-under=65`) — no tests exist yet. **WONTFIX for
     this PR**: expected until Phase 2/3 add real backend tests; documented in the PR body,
     not silently left unexplained.
  2. `Makefile` `openapi`/`migrate`/`seed` targets reference `app.cli.openapi_dump` /
     `app.cli.seed`, neither of which exist yet. **WONTFIX for this PR**: those modules are
     Phase 2/3 scope per the directory layout in `03-REPO-BOOTSTRAP.md §1`; adding them now
     is scope creep outside the declared Phase 0 slice.
  3. Verified `openai==1.54.*` sits correctly under `[project.dependencies]` (runtime), not
     `[project.optional-dependencies].dev` — needed at runtime by the later LLM triage
     provider, not just in tests. No change needed; flagged so a future edit doesn't
     "helpfully" move it into dev extras and break the production container's `make up`.
  4. `backend/tests/` has no `conftest.py` and no `unit/integration/contract` subdirs yet —
     markers are pre-registered in `pyproject.toml` (`markers = [...]`) so `--strict-markers`
     won't reject Phase 2+ test files, but the fixtures they'll need don't exist yet.
     **WONTFIX for this PR**: Phase 2+ scope, noted so the next window doesn't assume
     `conftest.py` fixtures are already wired.
- **I changed:** N/A — this is the finding-generation step itself, not a review of another
  tool's output.
